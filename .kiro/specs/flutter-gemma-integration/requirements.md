# Flutter Gemma Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the integration of the flutter_gemma plugin to replace the current AI implementation in the Noor learning app. The flutter_gemma plugin provides advanced capabilities including multimodal support (text + vision), function calling, better memory management, and cross-platform compatibility. This integration will serve as the foundation for enhanced learning features including vision-based learning, automated achievement systems, and improved course interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Flutter Gemma Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the flutter_gemma plugin to replace the current AI service, so that the app has a more robust and feature-rich AI foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the flutter_gemma plugin SHALL be properly initialized
2. WHEN a user sends a text message THEN the AI SHALL respond using the flutter_gemma plugin
3. WHEN the AI processes a request THEN it SHALL use local on-device inference without external servers
4. IF the model is not yet downloaded THEN the system SHALL handle model download with progress indication
5. WHEN the app is closed THEN all AI resources SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 2: Model Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI model to be efficiently managed on my device, so that I have fast responses without consuming excessive storage or memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first runs THEN the system SHALL download and install the appropriate Gemma 3 Nano model
2. WHEN downloading a model THEN the user SHALL see progress indication with percentage completion
3. WHEN a model is already installed THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing model without re-downloading
4. WHEN the device has limited memory THEN the system SHALL use efficient parameter loading techniques
5. IF model download fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3: Chat Interface Enhancement

**User Story:** As a student, I want to have natural conversations with the AI tutor, so that I can get personalized learning assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message THEN the AI SHALL respond with contextually relevant educational content
2. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN it SHALL stream tokens in real-time for better user experience
3. WHEN a conversation continues THEN the AI SHALL maintain context from previous messages
4. WHEN a user starts a new topic THEN the system SHALL create a new chat session
5. IF the conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL manage token limits gracefully

### Requirement 4: Vision-Based Learning Support

**User Story:** As a student, I want to take photos of problems, text, or diagrams and get AI assistance, so that I can learn from visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user takes a photo THEN the system SHALL process the image using multimodal AI capabilities
2. WHEN an image is sent with text THEN the AI SHALL analyze both the image and text together
3. WHEN processing an image THEN the system SHALL handle common formats (JPEG, PNG) automatically
4. WHEN the device has sufficient memory THEN vision processing SHALL be enabled by default
5. IF the device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable vision features

### Requirement 5: Function Calling Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to be able to call specific functions in the app, so that it can trigger achievements, update progress, and interact with app features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI needs to perform an action THEN it SHALL use the function calling capability
2. WHEN a function is called THEN the system SHALL execute the function and return results to the AI
3. WHEN function calling is not supported by the model THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully
4. WHEN a function call fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling
5. IF the AI suggests an action THEN it SHALL use function calls rather than just text responses

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to run efficiently on my mobile device, so that it doesn't drain battery or cause performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI is processing THEN it SHALL use GPU acceleration when available
2. WHEN the device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL fall back to CPU processing
3. WHEN not actively chatting THEN the system SHALL minimize resource usage
4. WHEN switching between features THEN AI sessions SHALL be properly managed
5. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cleanup strategies

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on any platform (Android, iOS, Web), I want the AI features to work consistently, so that I have the same learning experience regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Android THEN all AI features SHALL work with proper GPU support configuration
2. WHEN using iOS THEN the system SHALL handle iOS-specific requirements and permissions
3. WHEN using Web THEN text-based AI features SHALL work (with vision support coming later)
4. WHEN switching platforms THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent
5. IF platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue learning even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
2. WHEN inference fails THEN the user SHALL be notified and able to retry
3. WHEN network issues occur during model download THEN the system SHALL handle partial downloads
4. WHEN memory issues arise THEN the system SHALL reduce resource usage automatically
5. IF the AI becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide restart capabilities

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new AI system to work seamlessly with existing app features, so that my learning experience is enhanced rather than disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing chat features THEN they SHALL work with the new AI backend
2. WHEN accessing course content THEN the AI SHALL be able to reference and discuss it
3. WHEN user progress is tracked THEN the AI SHALL be aware of learning context
4. WHEN achievements are earned THEN the AI SHALL be able to acknowledge and celebrate them
5. IF existing features conflict THEN the integration SHALL prioritize user experience continuity

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and debugging capabilities, so that I can ensure the AI integration works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support loading models from assets for testing
2. WHEN debugging THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available for troubleshooting
3. WHEN testing different models THEN the system SHALL support easy model switching
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN token usage and response times SHALL be trackable
5. IF issues occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be available for debugging
