# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Noor educational app by implementing a comprehensive learning system with interactive courses, achievement tracking, and vision-based learning capabilities. The goal is to transform the basic course structure into an engaging, gamified learning experience that leverages the Gemma 3n AI model's multimodal capabilities for text, vision, and interactive tutoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Course Module System

**User Story:** As a student, I want to access structured, interactive learning modules within each course, so that I can progress through educational content in a systematic and engaging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a course THEN the system SHALL display a list of available modules with clear progression indicators
2. WHEN a user completes a module THEN the system SHALL automatically unlock the next module in the sequence
3. WHEN a user accesses a module THEN the system SHALL present interactive content including text, quizzes, and AI-assisted explanations
4. IF a user has not completed prerequisite modules THEN the system SHALL prevent access to advanced modules
5. WHEN a user is within a module THEN the system SHALL provide AI tutoring support through the Gemma 3n model
6. WHEN a user completes all modules in a course THEN the system SHALL mark the course as completed and award appropriate achievements

### Requirement 2: Achievement and Progress Tracking System

**User Story:** As a student, I want to earn achievements and track my learning progress, so that I stay motivated and can see my educational accomplishments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a learning milestone THEN the system SHALL award appropriate badges or achievements
2. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display earned achievements, progress statistics, and learning streaks
3. WHEN a user completes daily learning activities THEN the system SHALL track and display learning streaks
4. IF a user achieves specific learning goals THEN the system SHALL unlock special achievements and recognition
5. WHEN a user completes assessments THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics and provide progress analytics
6. WHEN a user reaches achievement milestones THEN the system SHALL provide celebratory feedback and unlock new content or features

### Requirement 3: Vision-Based Learning Integration

**User Story:** As a student, I want to use my device's camera to capture and analyze text, diagrams, or objects for learning assistance, so that I can get help with physical books, handwritten notes, or real-world objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates the camera scanner THEN the system SHALL capture images and process them using Gemma 3n's vision capabilities
2. WHEN a user captures text content THEN the system SHALL extract and analyze the text to provide explanations, translations, or educational context
3. WHEN a user captures mathematical equations or diagrams THEN the system SHALL interpret the content and provide step-by-step explanations
4. IF the captured content is unclear or unreadable THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to retake the image with guidance for better capture
5. WHEN vision analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL integrate the results with the AI chat interface for follow-up questions
6. WHEN a user captures educational content THEN the system SHALL optionally save the analysis to their learning history for future reference

### Requirement 4: Enhanced AI Tutoring Integration

**User Story:** As a student, I want the AI tutor to be contextually aware of my current course progress and learning goals, so that I receive personalized and relevant educational assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions in the AI chat THEN the system SHALL consider their current course progress and learning context
2. WHEN a user struggles with specific topics THEN the AI tutor SHALL provide adaptive explanations and additional practice opportunities
3. WHEN a user completes assessments THEN the AI tutor SHALL analyze performance and suggest targeted learning activities
4. IF a user requests help with course material THEN the AI tutor SHALL reference specific course content and provide relevant examples
5. WHEN a user uses vision features THEN the AI tutor SHALL seamlessly integrate visual analysis with conversational learning support
6. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery of topics THEN the AI tutor SHALL suggest advanced challenges or related learning opportunities

### Requirement 5: Offline Learning Content Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want all course content, achievements, and learning progress to be stored locally on my device, so that I can continue learning without internet connectivity while maintaining privacy and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive offline course content for all subjects
2. WHEN a user makes learning progress THEN the system SHALL store all data locally without requiring internet connectivity
3. WHEN a user earns achievements THEN the system SHALL persist achievement data locally with timestamps and progress details
4. IF the app is reinstalled THEN the system SHALL provide options to backup and restore learning progress locally
5. WHEN vision features are used THEN the system SHALL process all image analysis locally without sending data to external servers
6. WHEN the user accesses any feature THEN the system SHALL function completely offline while maintaining full functionality
