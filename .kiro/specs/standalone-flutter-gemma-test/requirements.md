# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a standalone Flutter application in the `testFlutterGemma` folder to test and validate the flutter_gemma plugin functionality. The app will serve as a proof-of-concept and testing ground for the flutter_gemma package before integration into the main Noor application. The standalone app will follow the official flutter_gemma documentation from https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gemma to implement basic local AI functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new Flutter project in the testFlutterGemma folder, so that I can test flutter_gemma functionality in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL generate a new Flutter project in the testFlutterGemma directory
2. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Flutter project files and structure
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL be separate from the existing Noor application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add the flutter_gemma dependency to the test project, so that I can use the local AI functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dependency is added THEN the system SHALL include flutter_gemma in pubspec.yaml
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL successfully resolve and download the flutter_gemma package
3. WHEN the dependency is configured THEN the system SHALL follow the official flutter_gemma documentation requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement basic flutter_gemma initialization, so that I can verify the plugin loads correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the flutter_gemma plugin
2. WHEN initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL handle any platform-specific requirements
3. IF initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN initialization succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm the plugin is ready for use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement model loading functionality, so that I can test local AI model management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading is triggered THEN the system SHALL attempt to load a Gemma model
2. WHEN a model is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading progress to the user
3. IF model loading fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error information
4. WHEN model loading succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm the model is ready for inference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement basic chat functionality, so that I can test AI inference capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a message THEN the system SHALL send it to the loaded Gemma model
2. WHEN the model processes a message THEN the system SHALL display the AI response
3. WHEN chat is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
4. IF inference fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and allow retry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple UI for testing, so that I can interact with the flutter_gemma functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a clean, simple interface
2. WHEN the UI is shown THEN the system SHALL include model status indicators
3. WHEN the UI is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for chat messages
4. WHEN the UI is active THEN the system SHALL show model loading and response states

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues with flutter_gemma integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN exceptions happen THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging output
4. WHEN errors are handled THEN the system SHALL allow graceful recovery where possible
