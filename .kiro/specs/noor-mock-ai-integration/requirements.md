## Introduction

The Noor app currently has navigation and AI service integration issues that prevent users from accessing the main functionality. The app gets stuck during AI service initialization, preventing users from reaching the dashboard and testing the chat functionality. We need to create a clean separation between the AI service initialization and the app's core navigation flow, allowing users to access the app immediately while providing a mock AI service for testing purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to launch directly to the dashboard without getting stuck on initialization screens, so that I can immediately access the app's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the StudentDashboardScreen
2. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to initialize any AI services during startup
3. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL complete the launch process within 5 seconds
4. WHEN the user navigates through the app THEN the system SHALL NOT show any model download or setup screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access the chat functionality with a mock AI service, so that I can test the chat interface without waiting for large model downloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the chat screen THEN the system SHALL display the chat interface immediately
2. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL use the MockAiService to generate responses
3. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display a realistic AI response within 3 seconds
4. WHEN the user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL provide varied and contextual responses
5. WHEN the chat service encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to have clean service initialization that doesn't interfere with navigation, so that I can easily switch between mock and real AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically initialize any AI services
2. WHEN the chat screen is accessed THEN the system SHALL initialize only the required service (mock or real)
3. WHEN switching between services THEN the system SHALL NOT require app restart
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging to distinguish between mock and real services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app navigation to work reliably across all screens, so that I can access all features without getting stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps navigation buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct screen within 1 second
2. WHEN the user is on any screen THEN the system SHALL allow navigation back to the dashboard
3. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain app state correctly
4. WHEN the user uses the back button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous screen or exit the app appropriately
