- **Performance Optimization**: Kiro identified bottlenecks and suggested pre-initialization strategies

**Key Code Generated with Kiro's Help:**
```dart
class GemmaNativeService {
  static GemmaNativeService? _instance;
  static GemmaNativeService get instance => _instance ??= GemmaNativeService._();
  
  // Kiro suggested singleton pattern for memory efficiency
  dynamic _modelInstance;
  dynamic _chatInstance;
}
```

**Breakthrough Moment:** Kiro helped identify that model pre-initialization on app startup would eliminate user wait times - a critical UX improvement.

**Code Example:**
```dart
Future<String> extractTextFromImage(String imagePath) async {
  // Kiro suggested this hybrid approach for optimal performance
  try {
    return await _processWithMLKit(imagePath);
  } catch (e) {
    return await _processWithGemma3N(imagePath);
  }
}
```
